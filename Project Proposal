Project Proposal
Our idea for a project is to make a first person shooter survival game, with a heavier focus on the games AI working together to kill you. Our plan is to have two game modes where the objective of the first is to escape from a building, collecting keys to open doors and escape, and the second mode involves seeing how long you can survive. The AI will be some type of monster in a small group hunting you down, using teamwork to defeat you.
