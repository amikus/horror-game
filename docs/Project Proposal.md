# Project Proposal

#### Description
Our game will be a three-dimensional, first-person shooter survival game with an emphasis on escape rather than on eliminating enemies. The player will begin in a small cell-like room with only a key and a locked door. After leaving the room, the player will navigate through a bounded space in search of an exit. The user's character will be confronted with several types of enemies, each of which will exhibit characteristics of a different type of artificial intelligence.

#### Multiple Game Modes
The game will have two game modes. The objective of the first mode will be to survive the attacks of the AI creatures, locate and gather a key, and escape through a doorway. The objective of the second mode will be to survive the attacks of the AI for as long as possible, with points accruing for each minute that the character survives.

#### Survival and Escape
The gameplay will be driven by exploration and the excitement of interacting with artificial intelligences (in both modes), and by gathering a key and escaping (in the escape mode). The game will not be story-driven, and little (if any) backstory will be provided for the player character.

#### Menu system and HUD
The game will be wrapped within a menu system which will allow the player to choose between the two game modes, and at the end of the game, text will appear prompting the player to quit or play again. In survival mode, the player will also be able to add his or her score to a traditional scoreboard. In-game, the player will utilize a standard Heads-Up Display (HUD) system to keep track of life totals and items.
